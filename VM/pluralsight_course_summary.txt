VM:
- Image: deployed onto VM, the OS
- Network
- Block storage: store VM and app data

When creating virtual network for VM, specify a subnet
-> Azure can generate it by itself though


Create from portal:
1) Virtual Network
- address space (?)
- subnet (name, address range?)

2) VM
Managed storage?
- select public inbound ports (here we can specify RDP in case of Windows VM, or SSH for Linux [but even http, https, ms sql])
